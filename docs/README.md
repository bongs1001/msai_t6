# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a model that predicts the daily closing price of overseas stocks using machine learning techniques. The project was conducted by a team of 6 members from October 31, 2024, to November 8, 2024.

## Project Goals

Develop a machine learning model that predicts the daily closing prices of overseas stock markets with high accuracy.
Implement the developed prediction model as a web application to provide users with real-time stock price prediction information.

## Key Features

Stock Ticker Input and Prediction Result Confirmation: Users can input the ticker of an overseas stock of interest and check the opening price and predicted closing price of the stock on the day.
Stock Price Chart Visualization: Visualize historical stock price data of the entered stock in chart form to help users easily grasp stock price fluctuation trends.
Provision of Daily Stock Price Information: Provide stock price information for a specific date to allow users to check stock price data at a desired time.

## Technologies Used

Machine Learning: LightGBM Regressor, GridSearchCV for optimal parameter setting
Web Development: Gradio
Data Analysis: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
Collaboration Tool: GitHub
